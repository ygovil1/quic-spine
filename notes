DHCP Daemon config can be found at:
/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf

DHCP Client config can be found at:
/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

To run the setup, start the mininet with the custom topology
Assuming you're in the quic-spine directory, run

sudo mn --custom ./mininet/DHCP_Topo.py --topo mytopo

Within the mininet CLI, run the following commands, in order:

# Start the DHCP server 
# If there is already a DHCP server running, this script will prompt you to kill it and restart the server
# This makes it easier to restart the DHCP server if you've changed the config logs
dhcp sh start_dhcpd.sh

# Start the DHCP client on the host
host sudo dhclient -v -1

# Start the QUIC server on the server
serv sh start_server.sh

# Start the QUIC client on the host
host sh start_client.sh
